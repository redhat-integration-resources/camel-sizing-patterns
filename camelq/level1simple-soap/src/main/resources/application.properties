# It seems there was a regression.
#  - ref: https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/16089
# Service port now defaults to 80, but previously defaulted to http port.
# A JIRA ticket has been created to address the problem:
#  - https://issues.redhat.com/browse/ENTESB-19030
# The workaround is to set the following parameters to configure the service ports 
quarkus.openshift.ports.http.name=http
quarkus.openshift.ports.http.host-port=8080
quarkus.openshift.ports.http.container-port=8080
